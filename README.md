## Hi 🖐️

I'm **Gaëtan**, I'm 18 years old and I'm in my last year of high school.

I'm a PHP developer since now 2019 in the PocketMine-MP plugins domain, and since now a few months I'm a web developer, I haven't found yet my preference between Back or Front end but I like both 😉

I made plugins like JobUI and Drawers for the [Histeria](https://histeria.fr/) server, I was for 1 year the main developer of [Atlas](https://github.com/SteellgoldPlugins/AtlasCore) during its V1 and the pre-release (beta) it was my best experience, which thanks to it I'm still here today, which taught me a lot of things

Currently I'm creating a website called "Vendit" which allows to sell plugins on this site, an alternative to Shoptly or Payship that many pocketmine developers use to sell their plugins

I am in a French developer community called "[Royaume](https://github.com/Virtual-Royaume)" on which I currently [participating](https://github.com/Virtual-Royaume/Royaume-Discord-Bot/issues?q=author%3ASteellgold) in the development of the Bot Discord.

It's a community where we love to learn and use new technologies, this is where I decided to go in the path of web development learning Svelte and make my first site in Bootstrap or templates: [Portfolio](https://steellgold.fr) in [open-source](https://github.com/Steellgold/Portfolio)
