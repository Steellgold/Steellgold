### Hi there :wave:

Gaëtan 17 years old, and I'm currently in 1rst Bac Pro in the Digital Systems field

[Version Française](https://github.com/Steellgold/Steellgold/FR_README.md)

Big or small, a project deserves a description, slide down for my repository!

**__Actives projects__**:
* 💰 [IsMyStore](https://github.com/isMyStore): Website on which you can sell digital files **(Since 2019)**
   * It's a project that is very close to my heart because it's my first big project outside of Minecraft, and it's also my high school project because it can motivate me to finish it, because I never managed to finish it because each time something didn't please me and I started again
* 🌍 [Universes](https://github.com/UniversesMCBE): A coming soon project
   * When you have an idea, you have to follow it and see what happens at the end of the tunnel, Universes is a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server, hence the type of server is still private for now. But it is a huge project that can not be done in a few months, I think it will take at least 1 year to release a beta, if I have a word to describe the server: Crazy.
* 🤖 [Rox](https://github.com/TheRoxBot): Robot Discord in JavaScript with more than 103k users for 12 servers to its credit, project abandoned due to lack of motivation in 2020 but restarted in May 2022 with [RomainSav](https://github.com/RomainSav) **(2019-2020, restarted in May 2022)**
   * Since I'm a developer especially in PHP, I rarely leave this comfort zone, Rox is one of my "desires" to get out and learn new things, especially after the stop of the bot I had no desire to touch JavaScript, but [Romain](https://github.com/RomainSav) gave me back the desire, because he knows more than me, so I followed him to redesign the project but better! and in TypeScript this time :wink:
* 🪙 [Wapy](https://github.com/WapyMC/): A Minecraft Bedrock Server, where I am developer, founder and content manager, with my sidekick RomainSav, the server progresses little by little according to our envy of the day  **(Since 2020)**
   * For Wapy: "Wapy, wapy, wapy I will never forget this name of my life, one of the things that made me discover a person who is today a great friend, despite many insults but between us we know that we laugh. Romain, I will never forget this person and this project. He thought of me to create a Minecraft server, and in 1 week we became great friends, I hope it is not ephemeral!"

**__Previous projects__**: 
* ⚔️ Atlas: Minecraft Bedrock Edition practice server with different game modes, developers during all its first version! **(2019-2020)**
   * I owe everything to this project, as well as to the person who invited me. At the beginning I was only supposed to be a developer during a party to help! and I was quickly invited as a developer, and 1 week almost just after manager, having carte-blanche to manage the server which became several big, the code does not reflect the quality of the server, the code is disgusting for sure, but everything has a beginning, and. . an end, this project was my very first big project for 1 year at least I developed a server, I played on it, I added what I liked to make it like other people. It was a crazy experience that taught me things I wouldn't have known today without Atlas. Thanks Calco for trusting me, and thanks [Red](https://github.com/RedTv-Developpement) for the invitation!

I will resume these projects when IsMyStore will be released
* 📁 PluginBuilder: Plugin builder for PocketMine-MP without having any knowledge in development
