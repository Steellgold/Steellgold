### Hi there! 

You want to know what I do, fine
- 🌐 I develop a website for online sales 
- ⛏️ I develop a SkyBlock server on @pmmp PocketMine-MP software
- 🏹 I develop a Video Game in Python for a school project [GameSchoolProject Repository](https://github.com/Steellgold/GameSchoolProject)

I have a little sadness on github because i have a GitHub account from 2015 that got deleted 🥺

PHP 🐘 developer, moderately good in JavaScript 📒
And never take out these projects if laziness is involved 😴
