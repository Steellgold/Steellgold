### Hi there! 

Gaëtan 17 years old and I was born in october because I don't know, currently in 1rst Bac Pro in the Digital Systems field

Actives projects:
* 💰 [IsMyStore](https://github.com/isMyStore): Website on which you can sell digital files


Previous projects: 
* ⚔️ Atlas: Minecraft Bedrock Edition practice server with different game modes, developers during all its first version!
* 🤖 Rox: Robot Discord in JavaScript with more than 103k users for 12 servers to its credit, project abandoned due to lack of motivation

I will resume these projects when IsMyStore will be released (at least in beta)
* 📁 PluginBuilder: Plugin builder for PocketMine-MP without having any knowledge in development
* 🤖 Alex The Bot: Robot Discord in TypeScript I'm doing it for fun but not especially the goal to make it public, rather to improve my TS knowledge
